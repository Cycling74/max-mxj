* PROJECTS

To run the tests here, add this entire repository to Max's Packages (in =~/Documents/Max 7/Packages=) - this is so that the Package machinery can locate Java classes and libraries in the ~java-classes~ directory.

See ~compile.sh~ for compilation details. We force Java 6 at language and bytecode level, and refer directly to the Apple Java 6 framework (and to a ~max.jar~ in the standard Max installation.) One Java >6 file is built for a test against it.

To build Project snapshots (adding the magic ~.maxtest.maxzip~ extension which makes them testable), run ~maxzip.sh~.

Both shell scripts must be run with current directory the same as their location.

* TESTS

| TEST                     | NOTES                                                        | STATUS |
|                          | <60>                                                         | <6>    |
|--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+--------|
| simple-instantiation     | Simple instantiation test. No bundled classes. Checks Max Console for errors. Does scripting, so might be at risk of UI hang bug. | PASS   |
| isolated-class           | Check instantiation of simple class from Project.            | PASS   |
| reports-java-version     | Simple check that Java version can be reported. Any version accepted. | PASS   |
| check-class-file-version | Check class file versions. (Seems to highlight issue with Project unpacking.) | PASS   |
| qualified-class-name     | Simple instantiation of class with qualified name. (Mainly test for compile script and packaging/unpacking.) | PASS   |
| qualified-class-name_JAR | As above, but with generated JAR file.                       | PASS   |
| clojure-test             | Simple Clojure script: testing library linkage.              | FAIL   |
| makes-sound              | Audio from mxj~ noise?                                       | PASS   |
| noise-gen                | Noise generated from Project-local performer subclass.       | PASS   |
| audio-file               | Audio file: Project-local class and audio file               | PASS   |
| test-context-classloader | Check that there's a thread context classloader in place     | FAIL   |
#+TBLFM:

* TO DO [0/3]

- [ ] It seems that we can see class files from projects other than the current one. Isolate this and formulate a test. (Probably just classes that aren't purged from the JVM.)
- [ ] Regexp in ~check-class-file-version~ is Mac-specific.
- [ ] In general: when we generate Project shapshots we aren't adding Windows binaries (for ~oscar~).

* UNCLEAR

- Are patchers supposed to be closed after a test?
- Are projects supposed to be closed after a test? (Probably not.)
- Is audio stopped after a test? (Probably not.)
