* PROJECTS

To run the tests here, add this directory to Max's search path. (Don't include sub-folders, although I don't think that'll actually matter if only the projects themselves have ~.maxtest~ in their names.)

See ~compile.sh~ for compilation details. We force Java 6 at language and bytecode level, and refer directly to the Apple Java 6 framework (and to a ~max.jar~ in the standard Max installation.)

* TESTS

| TEST                     | NOTES                                                        | STATUS |
|                          | <60>                                                         | <6>    |
|--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+--------|
| simple-instantiation     | Simple instantiation test. No bundled classes. Checks Max Console for errors. Does scripting, so might be at risk of UI hang bug. | PASS   |
| isolated-class           | Check instantiation of simple class from Project.            | PASS   |
| reports-java-version     | Simple check that Java version can be reported. Any version accepted. | PASS   |
| check-class-file-version |                                                              |        |
#+TBLFM:

* TO DO [0/1]

- [ ] It seems that we can see class files from projects other than the current one. Isolate this and formulate a test.
- [ ] Regexp in ~check-class-file-version~ is Mac-specific.
- [ ] In general: when we generate Project shapshots we aren't adding Windows binaries (for ~oscar~).
