# projects

To run the tests here, add this directory to Max's search path. (Don't include sub-folders, although I don't think that'll actually matter if only the projects themselves have `.maxtest` in their names.)

See `compile.sh` for compilation details. We force Java 6 at language and bytecode level, and refer directly to the Apple Java 6 framework (and to a `max.jar` in the standard Max installation.)
